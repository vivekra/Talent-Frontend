<a href="#a" itemprop="name">Is 15 days risk-free trial period completely free?</a>
</div>
<div className="accordian-text" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
<p itemprop="text">Yes, it's completely free. We allow this free time period to evaluate
the code quality, communication, on-time delivery, Agile software development
process, and more of the hired trial resource.</p>
<p>If you get satisfactory work, you can continue with the engagement; if the output
isn't desired, we will assign one more resource whose skills match your requirement.
If nothing of this either works, then you may right away cancel the engagement.</p>

</div>

<p itemprop="text">We have two different types of engagement models:-</p>
<p className="text-black"><b>Time & Material:</b></p>
<p>You can hire dedicated developers on a monthly basis (160 hours per month). This is
the most suitable model where the developer will work with you as your augmented
team member. Here you can also hire a developer on a part time basis (80 hours per
month).</p>
<p className="text-black"><b>Fixed price:</b></p>
<p>You can share your requirements with our team. Our team will evaluate your
requirements and then get back to you with the detailed estimation of your project
along with time and cost as well as the roadmap of the project.</p>
